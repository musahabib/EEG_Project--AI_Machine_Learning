# Predicting Worker Fatigue using EEG brainwave data

This project will create a ML model that will predict if a person is tired or not tired.

The folders in this repository contain the following:

**Data/:**

Data/Generated Images/: Greyscale images for Tired and Not Tired data. Images are based off data from Principal Component Analysis and were created using the imageio Python                             library.

Data/Preprocessed/: Data after initial preprocessing steps and feature generation.

Data/Raw/: Raw brainwave data as measured using the EEG.


**eegFG/:** Contains the referenced work by Jordan B. Bird in generating features of brainwave data to use in machine learning algorithms.

**Final Submission/:** Contains our final code and project report.

**Project Proposal/:** Contains the proposal made during the start of the project.
